## The End Result
[Demo (YouTube Short](https://youtube.com/shorts/vsDFVuusTj8)

In this Demo, I search for :
- "God of War"
- "Legend of Zelda"
- "Botw" (meaning Breath of the Wild)
and the results are convincing even with shortforms.

## Personal Playground for IGDB API

Working on this project helped me gain knowlegde about API especially IGDB's API. The worst part of working with an API is that there are rules for each request and if you misuse then you are thrown errors all around. I found that working with HTTP Request without an easing overlay is cumbersome. I tried it for the authentification and I hated it. That's when I came across IGDB-SWIFT-API which is a wrapper class for making request and receiving results in an organised manner.
This project is about benchmarking how well this package could improve code reusabilty and development time.
